# ElevatorSimulation

Elevator Simulation 

This is an attempt to develop a simulation of elevator(s) operation in a building. 

There are two types of elements in the design, mobile and static elements. The mobile elements are those that are constantly moving during the simulation, as a matter of fact this is indicative of their behavior in real life. 

The two mobile elements are:
1.	Elevator – this denotes an elevator with all the appropriate attributes.
2.	Person – this denotes an individual using the service of the elevator in the building.

The mobile elements implement the Runnable interface.

There are a few static elements:
1.  The ElevatorController - this serves the purpose of coordinating all the elevators in the building. 

2.  The Building - 

Implementation Approach
The implementation employs to a great extent the Observer pattern – this is the mode of communication amongst the elements abstracted in the implementation.



This is still in progress......
