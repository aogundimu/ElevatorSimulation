# ElevatorSimulation

This is an attempt to develop a simulation of elevator(s) operation in a building. There are two types of elements in the design, mobile and static elements.

The mobile elements are those that are constantly moving during the simulation, as a matter of fact thisis indicative of their behavior in real life. The two mobile elements are:




Following are the description of the components used in the design.



This is still in progress......
